We want to begin to formally recognize members of Wanchain’s online community who have stepped up and shown leadership within their own local communities. To achieve this, Wanchain is launching a Global Ambassador program aimed at bringing technical and non-technical people together on a global scale. We’re launching this program because:

**1.** We believe the future of any project in this space depends on widespread involvement, education, and advocacy in the community. Sharing knowledge and catering to those who are not as versed in the interoperability mission or the cryptocurrency industry in general is one of the primary goals behind this program.

**2.** We have over 70 employees at Wanchain but our whole community is many times larger. We want to leverage the community to the best of our capabilities through technical workshops, meetups, local marketing support and funding to those who want to spread the word about Wanchain and the importance of blockchain interoperability.

### Overall Categories of Involvement include:

**1.** **Support and Funding** — Wanchain will support your efforts in hosting local meetups, workshops, or other initiatives that you may propose.

**2.** **Professional Development** — You will gain professional and leadership experience by taking the initiative to grow a community in your region and help with other work based on your level of initiative and drive. In terms of how far you can take this role, the sky is the limit. We value and reward hard workers. We see our Global Ambassadors as special individuals who can grow into paid part-time or full-time roles at Wanchain.

**3.** **Inside Exposure**— As a Global Ambassador for Wanchain, you will participate in regular phone calls with key leaders, gaining insight into strategy, new products, and decision-making.

**4.** **Focus Group Participation** — As a Global Ambassador, you will be leveraged by Wanchain’s product team for demos and feedback sessions on new products being developed internally such as wallets, tools, or other new releases.

### Potential contributions include:

1. Hosting local meetups, workshops, or other initiatives (eligible for reimbursement)

1. Building online communities in your local language or region

1. Working on improvements to Wanchain’s documentation, tutorials, or other technical literature

1. Writing blog posts about Wanchain, interoperability, DeFi, or related topics

1. Creative/graphic design contributions

1. Pursuing potential collaboration opportunities that could benefit the Wanchain ecosystem

1. Participating in and helping moderate community channels (e.g. Telegram)

1. Developing or porting tools that could benefit Wanchain’s platform

1. Provide input into strategic decisions via conversations with Wanchain’s lead team

1. Become a leader among your other Global Ambassador peers in forums such as the Global Ambassador Telegram group where you will be able to share tips and other information with each other.

1. **Can I help with something that you haven’t listed above?** Absolutely! We encourage our Ambassadors to think creatively and strategically as to what work could continue to grow and improve Wanchain’s ecosystem, brand, and global presence.

1. **Am I qualified if I don’t speak completely fluent English?** Yes! We would like our Ambassadors to be able to communicate with the team in English. However, we do not expect you to be a completely fluent or native-level English speaker. This is all about growing the Wanchain brand in your home community, so use whatever language you and your community are most comfortable with.
